# 📈 AI-Enhanced Dynamic Investment Dashboard

### Automated Wealth Management & Market Benchmarking System

## 📖 Overview
This project is not just another standard spreadsheet. It is a comprehensive **financial ecosystem** developed within Google Sheets, leveraging **AI tools** to build complex automation scripts.

The goal was to move beyond static data and create a "Set & Forget" system that integrates live data, processes it in real-time, and visualizes actionable insights for smarter investment decisions.

## 💡 The Challenge & Solution
As an investor, I needed a way to cut through the noise of scattered data. I wanted to answer one simple question: **"How is my portfolio *really* performing against the market, net of all fees and taxes?"**

To solve this, I engineered a dashboard that focuses on five core pillars:

### 1. Triple Performance Analysis 🇺🇸 🇮🇱 📉
A comparative view that normalizes performance to the exact entry date of each position.
* **USD Return:** Asset performance in its native currency.
* **ILS Return:** Adjusted for real-time currency fluctuations.
* **Benchmark (S&P 500):** A direct comparison to the market index over the exact same holding period.

### 2. True Net Worth Tracking (After-Tax Liquidity) 💰
Most dashboards show "Paper Value." This system simulates a liquidation scenario in real-time:
* Calculates **Capital Gains Tax**.
* Adjusts for current **Forex rates**.
* Displays the **"True Net"** (cash-in-hand) value at any given moment.

### 3. Dynamic KPI Monitor 📊
A centralized tracking table designed for risk management and opportunity detection, monitoring key metrics:
* **P/E & PEG Ratios:** For valuation analysis.
* **Drawdown:** Measures the percentage drop from the asset's peak price to assess volatility and buy-the-dip opportunities.

### 4. Asset & Sector Allocation 🍰
Visual breakdown of the portfolio to identify over-concentration. This helps in maintaining a balanced risk profile by monitoring exposure across specific stocks and market sectors.

### 5. Historical Yield Visualization 📈
A visual performance graph comparing specific holdings against the S&P 500 from the day of purchase. This allows for:
* Correlation analysis (Beta).
* Volatility assessment.
* Evaluating the portfolio's relative strength against the market.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Google Sheets.
* **Automation:** Google Apps Script (GAS) & AI-assisted logic generation.
* **Data Source:** Google Finance API (Real-time).
